# Speech-Technology-Fall-2024
This repository includes the assignments and projects associated with my Speech Technology class at the University of Arizona
The following information is sourced directly from the course syllabus (written by Dr. Mike Hammond at the University of Arizona):


**Course Information**

This course is an introduction to speech synthesis and speech recognition, fo-
cusing on current non-neural techniques. (Neural techniques are covered in the
advanced course next semester.) We start with basic acoustics and how to repre-
sent the speech signal for computational purposes. We then turn to general finite-
state techniques including finite-state automata, transducers, weighted transduc-
ers, and hidden markov models. We then apply these in modern synthesis and
recognition systems.

**Learning outcomes**

This course addresses items #1, #3, and #4 below.

1. demonstrate ability to analyze patterns in language

2. show awareness of language usage patterns around the world

3. describe and address common misconceptions about language

4. communicate knowledge about linguistics through writing or orally
